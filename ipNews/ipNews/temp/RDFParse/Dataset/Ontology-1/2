Some celebrities' names are as outrageous as their stage costumes (Lady Gaga and Pink come to mind) but you may not realize just how many actors were born with names they shed or modified upon arrival in Hollywood. Whether to minimize (real or imagined) ethnic bias or just for vanity's sake, these big names are not the ones their parents gave them. Who changed for the better and who's just being silly? You decide.
